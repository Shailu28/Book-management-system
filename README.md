# Book Management System

The Book Management System is a Java-based application that enables users to manage books in a library or book collection. It utilizes the Core Java programming language and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database operations. The system provides basic functionality for adding, updating, and retrieving book information from a database.

## Requirements

To run the Book Management System, you need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
- A MySQL or any other compatible relational database management system (RDBMS) installed and running.
- JDBC driver for the corresponding database.

## Basic Features

The Book Management System includes the following basic features:

1. **Book Registration**: Users can add new books to the system by providing details such as book title, author, publication, ISBN, genre, etc.
2. **Book Update**: Users can modify existing book details, such as updating the author, publication, or genre of a book.
3. **Book Search**: Users can search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, publication, or ISBN. The system retrieves and displays matching books.
4. **Book Listing**: The system provides a list of all books in the database, allowing users to view the complete collection.
5. **Book Details**: Users can select a specific book from the list to view its detailed information, including all available details.
6. **Book Removal**: Users can delete books from the system if they are no longer part of the library or collection.

## Database Structure

The Book Management System relies on a relational database to store book information. The database should include a table named `books` with the following columns:

- `book_id`: Unique identifier for each book (integer or string).
- `title`: Title of the book (string).
- `author`: Author of the book (string).
- `publication`: Publication details of the book (string).
- `isbn`: International Standard Book Number (ISBN) of the book (string).
- `genre`: Genre or category of the book (string).

## Getting Started

To run the Book Management System, follow these steps:

1. Set up the database: Create a new database in your MySQL or RDBMS of choice. Create a table named `books` with the required columns as described above.
2. Set up the JDBC driver: Download the appropriate JDBC driver for your database and add it to your project's classpath.
3. Import the project: Import the Book Management System project into your chosen IDE.
4. Configure the database connection: Update the database connection parameters in the source code to match your database configuration (database URL, username, password).
5. Build and run the project: Compile and run the project using your IDE's built-in tools.

## Conclusion

The Book Management System provides a basic foundation for managing book collections or libraries. By utilizing Core Java and JDBC, the system allows users to add, update, search, and remove books from a database. The provided features can be extended to meet specific requirements or integrated into a larger library management system.

Feel free to add any additional features or customize the system based on your specific needs.
